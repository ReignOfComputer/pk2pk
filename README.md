Transfer Tool aka "Time Capsule" to transfer Pok√©mon between generations.

Emulates the transfer of input PKM entity files by utilizing [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX)'s class library.
For transfer methods that are not 'official' (such as transferring backwards from Gen IV to Gen III) the program will fake the transfer by transferring as many properties as possible to a blank file.
